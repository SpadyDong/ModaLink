## ModaLink: Unifying Modalities for Efficient Image-to-PointCloud Place Recognition

> Sync updates on https://github.com/haomo-ai/ModaLink

*  We propose a lightweight cross-modal place recognition method called ModaLink based on FoV transformation. 
*  We introduce a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-based module to extract extra potential semantic features to improve the distinctiveness of descriptors.
*  Extensive experimental results on the KITTI and a self-collected dataset show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance while running in real-time at about 30Hz.
